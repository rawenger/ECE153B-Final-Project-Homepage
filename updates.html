	<h2>Week 1: 2/18 - 2/25</h2>
	<p>After a LOT of work, I finally got the USB stack up and running, and the board now enumerates as an HID device when connected to my computer!&nbsp; It's highly satisfying using the nunchuk to control the mouse cursor on my laptop and iPad, but it's time to move on.&nbsp; Now that USB (and I<sup>2</sup>C) are ready, I've begun to lay out the basic code structure for the top-level application state machine which will handle program flow. I've also started bringup on the driver for the LCD display that will be used as the main UI.&nbsp; Once that is done, the next big goal to tackle is reverse-engineering the game physics of Cup Pong so the bot will be able to determine how much "force" (a.k.a mouse movement) is required to target a given cup.</p>
